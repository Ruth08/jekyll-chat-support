            <p>Live chat support helps companies interact with their customers by proactively inviting them to an online chat to provide support regarding their products or services in real-time. Chat support provides companies with an effective two-way communication system that can be utilized as an interactive customer support tool, as well as an effective marketing aid that converts browsers into buyers by providing them with sales and marketing support. Additionally, in comparison with live phone support, which requires heavy initial investment and high operating expenses, live chat support is available at a cost-effective and affordable price structure. We also specialize in providing the best-in-class video chat customer services at cost-effective prices.</p>

            <h3>How does Live Chat Support Work?</h3>
            <p>Chat support is pre-configured, easy to install and does not require additional modules or add-ons to be installed by the visitor. It uses functionalities available in any modern browser by default. When a visitor to your website requires assistance of any kind, all they have to do is click on the "click-to-chat" button prominently placed on your website. This will initiate a live chat session with a customer care executive, who will provide real-time answers to the customer's queries, and also cross-sell and up-sell your products and services in the process.</p>
